If you've ever tried to learn to code from a book or a website before, you've probably gotten bored out of your mind. Why? Because the authors teach in incredibly boring hypothetical questions that have no apparent value.

What if, instead of learning from static, boring, hypotheticals, every lesson was suited to fit your interests? That's what Intercode is all about.
